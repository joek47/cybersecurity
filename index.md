### OS security
Linux may be more secure largely due to fewer exploits being discovered in Linux than in Windows. 
Windows is the most used OS, therefore to get the most bang for their buck, most cyber researchers and attackers
focus their effort on Windows.

As we can see from exploit-db, Linux, like Windows, has vulnerabilities,

To manage cyber threats the priority is to patch it regularly and harden it with layers of defence 
, i.e. browser blocker plug-in, sandbox your browser, run your broswer in VM to better secure your system.

### Sandbox
Sandboxie is one sandbox application in Windows. Programs in the sandboxie can only modify the contents of the sandbox.
The yellow border around the application window shows that the application is being sandboxed, adding another layer of defence in your system.

For Linux, I use the simple firejail to sandbox applications.
