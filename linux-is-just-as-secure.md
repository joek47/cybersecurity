### Linux could be more secure

![why linux is more secure](/images/why_linux_is_more_secure.png)

Linux may be more secure largely due to fewer exploits being discovered in Linux than in Windows. 
Windows is the most used OS, therefore to get the most bang for their buck, most cyber researchers and attackers
focus their effort on Windows.
As we can see from exploit-db, Linux also has vulnerabilities, just like Windows.

Whichever OS you use, to manage cyber threats the priority is to patch it regularly and harden it with layers of defence 
, i.e. browser blocker plug-in, sandbox your browser, run your broswer in VM to better secure your system.
